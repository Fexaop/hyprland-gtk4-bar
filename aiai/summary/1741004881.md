**2. Key Feature Changes and Improvements**

*   **Turbopack:**  Next.js 15 marked Turbopack as stable for development (`next dev --turbo`).  Next.js 15.2 further improved Turbopack's performance, reporting up to 57.6% faster compile times and a 30% reduction in memory usage compared to Next.js 15.1. This makes Turbopack generally faster than Webpack.

*   **Server Actions:** Next.js 15 significantly enhanced the security of Server Actions. Endpoints are now unguessable, and unused actions are automatically removed during the build process, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

*   **Async Request APIs:**  A major breaking change in Next.js 15 is the transition to asynchronous request APIs.  Functions like `cookies()` and `headers()` are now asynchronous (using `await`).  A codemod (`npx @next/codemod@canary next-async-request-api`) is provided to assist with migration.

*   **Caching Changes:**  Next.js 15 fundamentally changed the default caching behavior.  Fetch requests and GET Route Handlers are *no longer cached by default*.  Developers must explicitly opt into caching using options like `cache: 'force-cache'` in `fetch()` calls or route config options.  This provides greater control over data freshness.

*   **Partial Prerendering (Experimental):**  Next.js 15 introduced Partial Prerendering (PPR) as an experimental feature. PPR allows mixing static and dynamic elements on the same page, optimizing performance by delivering a fast initial static response while streaming dynamic content based on React Suspense boundaries.

*   **`<Form>` Component:** A new `<Form>` component was introduced in Next.js 15, extending the standard HTML `<form>` element with features like prefetching, client-side navigation, and progressive enhancement.  This simplifies form handling, especially for forms that navigate to new pages.

* **Streaming Metadata:** Introduced in Next.js 15.2, this allows initial UI to be sent to the browser before `generateMetadata` has finished.

*   **`instrumentation.js` (Stable):** The `instrumentation.js` file and its `register()` API reached stability in Next.js 15, enabling performance monitoring, error tracking, and integration with observability libraries like OpenTelemetry.

*   **`unstable_after` API (Experimental):** This experimental API allows developers to schedule non-essential tasks (like logging or analytics) to run *after* the main response has been sent to the user, improving perceived performance.

*   **React View Transitions (Experimental):** Next.js 15.2 introduced experimental support for the React View Transitions API, enabling animations between different views and components.

*   **Node.js Middleware (Experimental):** Next.js 15.2 also introduced experimental support for using the Node.js runtime in Middleware.

*   **Improved Error UI:** Next.js 15.2 features a redesigned error UI with improved stack traces, making debugging easier.

* **TypeScript Configuration**: The `next.config.js` file can now be written in TypeScript (`next.config.ts`), providing type safety.

**3. Breaking Changes**

The most significant breaking changes requiring code updates are:

*   **Async Request APIs:** The shift to asynchronous functions for `cookies()`, `headers()`, etc.
*   **Caching Behavior:** The change to `no-store` as the default caching behavior for fetch requests and GET Route Handlers.
*    **`next/image`:** Removed `squoosh` in favor of `sharp`.
*   **Minimum Node.js Version:** Updated to 18.18.0.

**4. Performance Improvements**

Next.js 15 and 15.2 offer substantial performance improvements:

*   **Turbopack:** Up to 76.7% faster local server startup, up to 96.3% faster code updates with Fast Refresh, and up to 45.8% faster initial route compilation (without caching) in Next.js 15.  Further improvements in 15.2 (up to 57.6% faster compile times, 30% less memory usage).
*   **Caching Changes:** While a breaking change, the new caching behavior allows for more fine-grained control, leading to potentially significant performance gains when used correctly.
*   **Partial Prerendering:**  Provides a fast initial static response, improving perceived performance.
* **Smaller Javascript Bundles**: With RSC and Server Actions, less code is sent to the browser.

**5. Security Updates**

*   **Server Actions:** Unguessable IDs and automatic removal of unused actions significantly enhance security.
*   **Caching Changes:** The `no-store` default prevents unintentional caching of sensitive data.
*   **`instrumentation.js`:** Facilitates integration with observability tools for better security monitoring.

**6. Internationalization (i18n) and Accessibility (a11y)**

Next.js has built-in support for i18n routing (since version 10).  Key features include:

*   **Locale Detection:** Automatic detection of the user's preferred locale.
*   **Sub-path Routing:**  Locales are included in the URL path (e.g., `/en/blog`).
*   **Domain Routing:** Different locales can be served from different domains.
*   **Integration with Localization Libraries:** Next.js works well with libraries like `next-intl`, `react-intl`, and others.

Next.js also provides a good foundation for building accessible applications, although specific accessibility implementations are the responsibility of the developer.

**7. Debugging and Testing**

*   **Turbopack:** Faster build times significantly improve the development and testing cycle.
*   **`instrumentation.js`:**  Allows for deep integration with observability and monitoring tools.
*   **Improved Hydration Error Messages:** Next.js 15 provides clearer error messages for hydration mismatches.
*   **Codemods:** Automated code modifications (`@next/codemod`) simplify upgrading and migrating to new versions.
*   **Static Route Indicator:** Visually highlights which routes are static or dynamic, aiding in performance optimization.
* **Redesigned Error UI**: Next.js 15.2 features a redesigned error UI and improved stack traces to aid in debugging.

**8. Configuration Changes**

*   **Async Request APIs:** Require changes to how `cookies()`, `headers()`, etc., are used.
*   **Caching Semantics:**  Require explicit configuration for caching behavior.
*   **`next.config.ts`:** Allows using TypeScript for the configuration file.
*   **`bundlePagesRouterDependencies`:** (Stable) Allows bundling external packages in the Pages Router.
* **`serverExternalPackages`:** (Stable) Allows opt-out of specific packages for bundling.
*   **`staleTimes`:**  Allows configuring client-side caching behavior.
*   **Experimental Flags:**  `experimental.viewTransition` and `experimental.nodeMiddleware` enable new features.

**9. Code Examples**

*Enabling React View Transitions (Next.js 15.2)*
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
};
```

*Enabling Node.js Middleware (Next.js 15.2)*

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    nodeMiddleware: true,
  },
};

// middleware.js
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

const API_KEY_HASH = process.env.API_KEY_HASH;

export default async function middleware(req) {
  const apiKey = req.headers.get('x-api-key');
  if (!apiKey || !(await bcrypt.compare(apiKey, API_KEY_HASH))) {
    return new Response('Forbidden', { status: 403 });
  }
  console.log('API key validated');
}

export const config = {
  runtime: 'nodejs',
};
```

*Using Async Request APIs (Next.js 15+)*
```javascript
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

export async function AdminPanel() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const token = cookieStore.get('token');
  // ...
}
```

*Opting into Caching (Next.js 15+)*
```javascript
fetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' });
```

*Using the `<Form>` component (Next.js 15+)*
```javascript
import Form from 'next/form';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Form action="/search">
      <input name="query" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```
*Using `next.config.ts` (Next.js 15+)*
```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next';

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
};

export default nextConfig;
```
